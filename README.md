# freemodbus-esp8266
FreeMODBUS library port for ESP8266 RTOS SDK.

This is a working demo project, just run gen_misc.sh and upload it to your ESP, assuming you have a working build environment.

Tested with a Wemos D1 Mini, with baudrates 19200, 38400 and 115200. You can only use UART0, since UART1 has only TX pin.

### Requirements
- ESP8266
- ESP8266 RTOS SDK
